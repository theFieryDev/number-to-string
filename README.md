## Getting Started
- TODO

# Default behavior
- TODO

## #addStringPrototypes()
If you are so inclined to let `number-to-string` try to prototype the `String` object, feel free to call the `#addStringPrototypes()` method.  This will *non-destructively* add each of the functions to the `String` object, if there is no existing definition.  This can safely be called multiple times, without concern.

# String helpers
- TODO
